Introduction","text":"<p>Bridge construction is a critical branch of civil engineering focused on designing and building structures that span physical obstacles such as rivers, valleys, or roads, enabling uninterrupted transport and communication. Bridges play an essential role in modern infrastructure and economic development, often serving as vital connectors between regions.</p> <p>Why It Matters Bridges are engineering feats that must combine functionality, safety, and longevity. A well-designed bridge can last for decades, withstand environmental stresses, and carry vast volumes of traffic. Poor construction, on the other hand, can result in catastrophic failures.</p> <p>Who This Guide Is For This guide is intended for: * Civil engineering students and graduates * Construction site engineers and supervisors * Infrastructure planners and project managers * Government transportation departments</p>"},{"location":"#2-key-terminology","title":"2.
